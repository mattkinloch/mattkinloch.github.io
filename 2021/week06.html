            <p>About what you'd expect with deviations this week so I'll keep it short. To be fair, even if there was something unexpected I would still be keeping it short because I have no motivation to do this anymore.</p>
            
            <p>All the deviations are slowly centering around 15-20 points. The one exception is <b>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</b> for reasons that he will be absolutely grilled over in a later section. We'll get there, trust me.</p>

            <p>ESPN had their second-worst week of the season with their projections, averaging <b>20.63</b> points off of actual scores. This wasn't even influenced by <b>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</b> starting a player marked OUT well in advance, as they projected 0 points for that player. No excuses for this shit week ESPN, sorry.</p>
         
            <p>It seems like every week <b>female playing</b> and <b>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</b> come the closest to their projected scores, but sadly only one of those teams seems to walk away with W's. Luck is a cold, cold bastard. We had a lot of 20+ projection differentials, with <b>COOKing Dinner</b>, <b>Boston Weathermen</b>, and <b>Scrub Daddy</b> booming, and <b>Wandisimo</b> and <b>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</b> experiencing two very sad busts.

         <p>We'll run through the big takeaways here real quick:</p>
            
         <li><b>Boston Weathermen</b> are frauds.</li>
         <li><b>Earl Thomas' Brother</b> is also a fraud but not as much.</li>
         <li><b>COOKing Dinner</b> is super unlucky.</li>
         <li><b>Scrub Daddy</b> is king.</li>

         <p>Now onto our usual unluckiest loser and luckiest winner:</p>
            
         <p>We had one HELL of a lucky winner this week. With by far the luckiest win of the season so far, the 9th highest scorer <b>Wuhan Bats</b> somehow walked away with a win this week, all thanks to being matched up with the 10th highest scorer <b>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</b>. To make it even more painful for the rest of us, this extreme luck kept his winning streak alive and he remains the only undefeated team even after such a pitiful performance. Sigh.</p>
            
         <p>The unluckiest loss this week was nothing egregious, but still a bit unlucky. It's the kind of win where yes it is <i>technically</i> unlucky, but if the loser complained about it I would bully them. The 5th highest scorer this week <b>Earl Thomas' Brother</b> was matched up against the 3rd highest scorer <b>Boston Weathermen</b>. He would have beaten more teams than he wouldn't have, but only by one, and I don't care. Next section!</p>

         <h1>The Fr. Linnane's Special Little Hound Award</h1>

         <p>Our award winner this week is just an absolute darling and the funniest guy you'll ever meet and also saved a poor family of 5 from an apartment fire this week but isn't telling anyone about it because he doesn't have anything to prove to anyone. Really just a standup dude. With <b>168.75 points</b>, this week's winner was ahead of the rest of the league by over 20 points. That's a special little hound if I've ever seen one.</p>

         <h1>The Lou of the Week Award</h1>

            <p>I'm not sure this award encapsulates just how terrible the <b>67.85 point</b> performance the winner put up this week was. Not only was it a record low score, it was a score so low that I'm pretty confident it won't be beaten this season. Things might not have been nearly as bad had our lucky winner not started a player designated OUT for the second week in a row. Just brutal stuff.</p>

         <p>There's no surprise. I tricked you. With simply a few words, I took control over your free will and got you to scroll down a whole webpage for nothing. What's it like, knowing I have that power over you? Must be scary. I am the master of my own universe, a universe that you are all so unwillingly a part of, and nothing can stop me. See you next week ;)</p>

   <h1>Washed Up Greyhounds Weekly Roundup</h1>
   <h1>Week 2</h1>

   <p>Oh, hello. Welcome back to the Washed Up Greyhounds Weekly Roundup. So much has happened since we last spoke. The Wyman Boys reunited in Baltimore, visited the good ol' Rally in the Alley stomping grounds, and as we all saw coming, things went to shit. Basement couches were defiled. Blood was shed. Elvis ate the curb of Fleet St. for lunch, Grace fell in slow motion in the middle of a crosswalk, and Pat savagely savegely suplexed Cam in the noggin. It was a brutal Saturday for us here in Baltimore, and we can only hope our friends in Denver, Jersey and Connecticut fared better.</p>
   
   <p>Let's check in on our favorite league darlings and see how everyone's faring after a massive second week of fantasy football (Ryan included this time, my bad):</p>

   <h1>Introductions</h1>
   
   <h2>Wuhan Bats</h2>
   <h3>Jawn Lunch</h3>
   <p>1-0</p>
   <p>Let's go Chelsea baby fuck yea.</p>   
   <br>

   <h2>Wharf Rat Owners</h2>
   <h3>Patrick Authority</h3>
   <p>0-1</p>
   <p>Last seen lurking in the shadows of 912 S. Bouldin St.'s basement.</p>

   <h2>Wandisimo</h2>
   <h3>Colin Burke</h3>
   <p>1-0</p>

   <p>0-1</p>
   <p>Ohhh I get the pun now.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Boston Weathermen</h2>
   <h3>Matthew James Cunniff</h3>
   <p>1-0</p>
   <p>It was between that and Mohammed.</p>

   <br>

   <h2><strike>female playing female playing</strike></h2>
   <h2><strike>female playing .</strike></h2>
   <h2>female playing</h2>

   <br>

   <h2>Earl Thomas' Brother</h2>
   <h3>Elvis Smuth</h3>
   <p>1-0</p>
   <p>Would be 1-2 if that scooter ride counted towards fantasy.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Scrub Daddy</h2>
   <h3>Matt Kinny</h3>
   <p>1-0</p>
   <p>Creature from the purple patio.</p>

   <br>

   <p>Now, let's get down and dirty folks.</p>

   <br>

   <h1>&#128680;Trade Alert&#128680;</h1>
   
   <p>Holy MOLY ladies and gentlemen we had ourselves the very first trade of the season this past week. I'll keep this section short and sweet because if it runs too long certain people will lose interest after 30 seconds.</p>
   
   <table class="center">
      <tr>
         <th>Team:</th>
         <th>Scrub Daddy (Matt Kinloch)</th>
         <th>Wharf Rat Owners (Pat Auth)</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <th>Receives:</th>
         <th>Jalen Hurts, QB (PHI)<br>Graham Gano, K (NYG)</th>
         <th>Devonta Smith, WR (PHI)<br>Younghoe Koo, K (ATL)</th>
      </tr>
   </table>
   
   <p>As the weeks progress, I'll begin trying to declare the winners and losers of each trade by looking at the value acquired players bring to each team based on their performance vs the performance of players that team is replacing... or something idk.</p>

   <br>

   <h1>Consistent Constipation</h1>

   <p>Consistency is the name of the game folks. Or is it? I consistently get drunk on weekends and that doesn't seem to be doing much good for my long term aspirations. It certainly helps to deal with the stress of this stupid made up fantasy game we all agreed to play though. Who even came up with fantasy? Bill "Wink" Winkenbach, that's who. Yea, I googled it. Shocking right. If Bill Winkenbach never gathered his friends together in a ritzy New York City hotel room in the late summer of '62 and invented imaginary teams that score imaginary points in an imaginary game, none of us would be in this mess. You're a rat bastard, Bill Winkenbach.</p>
  
   <p>Courtesy of Matthew James Cunniff, we're going to start tracking the standard deviation of each team's scores across the season, and seeing who's scores are most consistent. More importantly than that, we're going to see if consistency translates into wins. Spoiler alert: I'm guessing the only consistency we see is one sad team consistently getting stomped.</p>

   <h1>ESPN Sucks</h1>

   <p>When I broke into my therapist's house in the middle of the night last Tuesday to tell her I did my one good deed of the week by buying a homeless guy a pack of Newport 100's, she told me that I need to do a better job at relating to people and to stop being so self-centered, and then threatened to call the police. So, I'm gonna try some relatable content that's specifically tailored to our leaguemates here. Don't you just hate it when you're baking bread and forget it in the oven? Don't you hate it when you want to watch South Park but you have to finish your shift at the ice cream store? Isn't it so annoying when people keep calling you big and sexy? I know I sure do.</p>

   <p>You know what else I hate? ESPN. Let's take another peek at how bad they are at predicting the future:</p>

   <h1>The Fr. Linnane's Special Little Hound Award</h1>

   <p>The Fr. Linnane's Special Little Hound Award might just be the most important award of the week. Not just because it means you kicked everyone's asses, but also because if you don't pay attention to it, you run the risk of playing the fool. Imagine this: you're walking down a dark alley at night. Suddenly, a shadowy figure emerges from the darkness with a gun in his right hand and a hot pink handbag in his left. The handbag isn't important to this scenario, but what is important is having a good fashion sense, and this guy knows it. He bought it from Kate Spade last weekend and he thinks it's important to look fashionable while committing crimes. You know, self care and all that liberal mumbo jumbo. He says to you, "Tell me who won Fr. Linnane's Special Little Hound Award this week, or I'll shoot you right here and now". If you didn't read the entire Washed Up Greyhounds Weekly Roundup that week because you don't like fun, you're about to lay dead in the street. So now you know.</p>
   <p>The Fr. Linanne's Special Little Hound of Week 2 is...</p>

   <h3>Matt Kinloch</h3>

   <p>Congrats, you sucked the least!</p>

   <h1>The Lou of the Week Award</h1>

   <p>Lou visited me in my dreams again last night. We were in the middle of an open prarie at dusk, and he looked me in the eyes with a frightengly blank stare. He said "Shark Bait Hoo Hah Hah". I jolted out of bed in a cold sweat. Milk, curled up beside me, let out a big stretch and repositioned his massive dumptruck ass. I laid back down and checked my phone. There was a text: "Also, another week, another time I lead the league in scoring. Some things never change", it said. And how right that text was - the fantasy gods never change. They witnessed this gross act of misplaced hubris and were given no choice but to lay down their massive schlongs in a way only they know how. It was not enough that this puny mortal embarassed himself by making a false claim to the Fr. Linanne's Special Little Hound throne. The fantasy gods are cruel and unforgiving, and they demanded blood.</p>
   <p>The Lou of the Week goes to, drumroll please...</p>

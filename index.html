   <h1>Washed Up Greyhounds Weekly Roundup</h1>
   <h1>Week 13</h1>

   <p>Today, we open our recap with a moment of reflection. It's that time of the year where the fabled "Playoff Chance" column has finally fallen to 0 for a few of our brethren. There will be no making fun of anyone. No gloating, no raging, no "I told you so"'s. Only a somber moment to appreciate those we have lost. Let us pray:</p>

   <h1>In Memoriam</h1>

   <h2>Wharf Rat Owner</h2>
   <h3>Patrick Auth</h3>
   <p>5-8</p>
   <p>We are gonna miss you buddy.</p>

   <h2>Wandisimo</h2>
   <h3>Colin Burke</h3>
   <p>4-9</p>
   <p>I guess you could say he ruh'ed his last roh.</p>
   
   <h2>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</h2>
   <h3>Ryan Luca</h3>
   <p>3-10</p>
   <p>If only you were better at writing speeches :(.<p>
   
   <p>Rest in Peace, brethren.</p>
   
   <h1>The Side of the Living</h1>
   
   <p>And then there were 7. What a ragtag groups of silly little people we have here. Next week, we'll be down to 6. I'll pretend that it's not incredibly obvious who the next person to die is by saying it's really anyone's game still. Let's see what's up:</p>
   
   <h2>Wuhan Bats</h2>
   <h3>Jawn Lunch</h3>
   <p>10-3</p>
   <p>The chances of him NOT getting first are slim... but never - What's that? They are 0? Shit.</p>   
   <br>

   <br>

   <h2>COOKing Dinner</h2>
   <h3>Andrew Fallus</h3>
   <p>7-6</p>
   <p>I was going to say maybe you woulda won if you didn't start Henderson, but your entire bench combined also put up 0.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Boston Weathermen</h2>
   <h3>Matthew James Cunniff</h3>
   <p>8-5</p>
   <p>If you finish with a better record than me I will cry.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>female playing</h2>
   <h3>Colleen "Lean" McCormack and Will "Willean" McCormack</h3>
   <p>6-7</p>
   <p>Making playoffs is easy! You just have to do is win, outscore Elvis by 50, and hope that he loses to... Scrub Daddy. Oh no. You're doomed.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</h2>
   <h3>Sara Aloupis and Sara Aloupis' Fantasy Slave</h3>
   <p>7-6</p>
   <p>Turns out Sara never owned a team and it was Skankhunt42 trolling the whole time.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Earl Thomas' Brother</h2>
   <h3>Elvis Smuth</h3>
   <p>7-6</p>
   <p>Wockie Slush.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Scrub Daddy</h2>
   <h3>Matt Kinny</h3>
   <p>8-5</p>
   <p>Holy shit I actually won a game.</p>

   <br>

   <p>I really don't want to write this roundup fml.</p>

   <p>Takeway time! Here we go:</p>
      
   <li><b>Boston Weathermen</b> think he's unlucky, but really he's lucky to not be tied with <b>female playing</b> like he should be.</li>
   <li><b>Scrub Daddy</b> does not understand how he is still fake 1st.</li>
   <li><b>COOKing Dinner</b> v <b>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</b> is an underappreciated rivalry this season.</li>
   <li><b>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</b> and <b>Wandisimo</b>'s race for last is somehow more exciting than everyone else's race for first.</li>
      
   <p>This week's unluckiest loser is of course someone who absolutely needs wins to stay in the playoff race, but got screwed by being matched against the highest scorer of the week, <b>Wuhan Bats</b> with <b>143.25 points</b>. <b>COOKing Dinner</b> has the honor of holding this title, as his 4th highest score of <b>119.15 points</b> just didn't cut it. Go cook some dinner and cry over it you nerd.</p>
	
   <p>Also, in an absolute miracle game for <b>Scrub Daddy</b>, <b>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</b> was unfortunately made the week's SECOND unluckiest loser. With a solid 5th highest score of <b>118.3 points</b>, he walked away with a fat L against the 2nd highest scoring <b>Scrub Daddy</b> with <b>128.7 points</b>. Needs an absolute monster game next week as a last ditch effort to not get bottom of the barrel.</p>
   
   <p>With high scoring players being matched up against high scoring players, the worst of the worst this week walked away with some pretty lucky wins. The luckiest had to have been <b>female playing</b>, and it came right when she needed it the most. Her 4th lowest score of <b>101.95 points</b> was just enough to squeeze out a win against the 2nd lowest scorer <b>Earl Thomas' Brother</b> with <b>85.95 points</b>. She was our luckiest winner last week, however, which just goes to show that life's a bitch.</p>

   <h1>The Fr. Linnane's Special Little Hound Award</h1>

   <p>Unfortunately for all of us, this week's Special Little Hound now moves into 1st place in the Special Little Hound Award winners standings, which was not official until just now when I decided it should be. With an impressive <b>143.25 points</b> this late into the season, our winner solidifies both his spot at the top of the actual standings and these fake meaningless standings.</p>
      
   <p>The Fr. Linanne's Special Little Hound of Week 10 is...</p>
   <h2>Wuhan Bats</h2>
   <h3>Jawn Lunch</h3>

   <p>Congrats, you sucked the least!</p>

   <h1>The Lou of the Week Award</h1>

      <p>This one stings a little. Our Lou of the Week couldn't have been awarded to someone less deserving, but here we are. A team making a last second playoff push with all of his fans cheering him on comes out on the field and... take a big steamy shit right infront of everyone. Unfortunate stuff. With <b>84.5 points</b>, our winner this week daggered himself out of a playoff spot and kept <b>female playing</b>'s dreams alive. Ouch.</p>

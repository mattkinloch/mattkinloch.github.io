   <h1>Washed Up Greyhounds REGULAR SEASON Roundup</h1>

   <p>It's finally over. 14 weeks of hell on earth only for a lucky few of us to have to suffer for 1-3 extra weeks for nothing but bragging rights and like 200 bucks. Also, Pat hasn't paid me still smh this is your public shaming. To those eliminated, congrats, you can delete the app for 9 months now. To the rest of us, I'm sorry. When your team inevitably shits the bed and loses, just remember that fantasy is the most important thing in your life and that you should be very, very upset.</p>
   
   <p>First order of business: grieving the loss of our final fallen soldier.</p>

   <br>

   <p>In perhaps the most undeserved BYE week of all time, <b>Earl Thomas' Brother</b> gets a free pass to the second round alongside God King Emperor <b>Wuhan Bats</b>. <b>Scrub Daddy</b> will square off against the team whose name reminds him of the nightmare he's had every night for the past 5 years, <b>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</b>. <b>Boston Weathermen</b> is matched up against <b>COOKing Dinner</b> and will probably lose. On a scale of 1-10 the meltdown will be a 100.</p>

   <h1>The Fr. Linnane's Special Little Hound Award</h1>

   <p>The final Fr. Linnane's Special Little Hound winner won this award in a spectacular fashion, scoring the most points out of any team in any week at the very last second of the regular season, with <b>173.9 points</b>. Making himself an immense playoff threat with such a monstrous performance, I'm glad I'm not the sucker forced to play him in the first round. Sorry Cunniff, good luck.</p>
      
   <p>The Fr. Linanne's Special Little Hound of Week 10 is...</p>

   <h1>The Lou of the Week Award</h1>

      <p>In an unexpected turn of events, a top dog of the league ends up as the final Lou of the Week award winner. With a dissapointing <b>89.05 points</b>, our winner should be glad his week has a BYE week to rest up even though they actually aren't resting and will probably wind up injured for when things actually matter in 2 weeks. Oh well, not my problem.</p>

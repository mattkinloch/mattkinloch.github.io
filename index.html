   <h1>Washed Up Greyhounds Weekly Roundup</h1>
   <h1>Week 11</h1>

   <p>Now that I am losing, I can safely say I hate fantasy football. This is like Dune, except instead of spice it's salt, and it's flowing through all of us. You have to be cool like me - who watched the movie, ordered the book, read 10 pages, and hasn't touched it since - to understand that reference. If you're reading this, say something mean to the person you played this week so we can really get the competitive juices flowing. No one? Okay. Let's get it moving.</p>

   <h1>Introductions</h1>

      <p>It was a real tight race for biggest dissapointment this week between <b>Wandisimo</b> and <b>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</b> as usual, but for a nice change of pace the latter pulled through. Missing his projection by <b>-33.05 points</b> makes <b>JBSW</b> the biggest bummer of the week, and that's just the first of many accolades yet to come for our golden boy. The biggest projection beater of the week was <b>Earl Thomas' Brother</b>, and all that needs to be said is: Jonathan Taylor.</p>

   <p>Takeway time! Here we go:</p>
      
   <li><b>JBSW</b> and <b>Wandisimo</b> are identically bad to actual standings.</b>
   <li><b>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</b> are making a last second comeback both hypothetically and actually.</li>
   <li><b>Scrub Daddy</b> is STILL somehow holding on (hypothetically).</li>
   <li><b>female playing</b> is the saddest story of the whole league. RIP.</li>
      
   <p>In an extremely refresing change of pace for all of us, <b>Wuhan Bats</b> finally got a taste of their own medicine and are this week's unluckiest loser. Putting up the week's second best performance with <b>135.35 points</b>, he lost to the highest scorer <b>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</b>. It quite literally couldn't have happened to someone more deserving.</p>
   
   <p>Wait a minute, this is HUGE, guys. For the first time all year we have perfect symmetry between the unluckiest loser and luckiest winner. The 2nd highest scoring team lost to highest scoring team, and 2nd lowest scoring team, <b>female playing</b> with <b>88.75 points</b>, beat the lowest scoring team <b>JBSW</b>. Wild stuff.</p>

   <h1>The Fr. Linnane's Special Little Hound Award</h1>

   <p>All I can think to say is, at least it wasn't <b>Wuhan Bats</b>. Congrats to our winner this week, who put up an impressive <b>151.75 points</b>. ALSO, with this win, all 10 teams in the league have officially won this award! Yes, even <b>Wandisimo</b> and <b>JBSW</b> have won, shocking I know. That's very impressive parity considering how skewed the standings look.</p>

   <h1>The Lou of the Week Award</h1>

      <p>Oh, my sweet summer child. It's honestly impressive that someone has won this award more than you, but I digress. You are now tied for 2nd most Lou of the Week wins, and you better not do it again or that spot on the podium will feel much more cold and alone. With <b>75.65 points</b> our free-win machine put up an expectedly pitiful performance. Good stuff!</p>

   <p>Shit's getting juicy. <b>Scrub Daddy</b> is rapidly falling down the standings, making the playoff spots in the East literally anyone's game. <b>Wandisimo</b> and <b>JBSW</b> are tied at the bottom desperately trying to break off from one another, while <b>Earl Thomas' Brother</b> is sitting comfy atop the West with a largely undeserved first round bye set in his sights. Let's see what happens folks. </p>

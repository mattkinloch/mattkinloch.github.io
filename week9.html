   <h1>Washed Up Greyhounds Weekly Roundup</h1>
   <h1>Week 9</h1>

   <p>Well, that was a shitshow of a week. It was the lowest scoring week by far, with 5 teams scoring under 100 points and 3 of those teams scoring under 77. Real brutal stuff. Lean embarassed Cunniff for the second time, sending him to the brink of tears which resulted in a tirade of texts that offered  every excuse for why he lost instead of the truth, which is that his team is bad. Elvis beat Pat by just over a point, and Pat went ballisti- I mean he said "damn", and moved on. Ryan started Davante Parker fucking AGAIN, who for the fifth time was marked OUT before game time. Let's take a closer look at how everyone's doing:</p>

   <h1>Introductions</h1>
   
   <h2>Wuhan Bats</h2>
   <h3>Jawn Lunch</h3>
   <p>8-1</p>
   <p>He can't keep getting away with it.</p>   
   <br>

   <h2>Wharf Rat Owners</h2>
   <h3>Patrick Authority</h3>
   <p>3-6</p>
   <p>The only thing more tragic than Macbeth was his game this week.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Wandisimo</h2>
   <h3>Colin Burke</h3>
   <p>3-6</p>
   <p>ruh roh (cont.)</p>

   <br>

   <h2>COOKing Dinner</h2>
   <h3>Andrew Fallus</h3>
   <p>4-5</p>
   <p>Can only sometimes solve crosswords marginally faster than me.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Boston Weathermen</h2>
   <h3>Matthew James Cunniff</h3>
   <p>5-4</p>
   <p>Old man yells at clouds.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>female playing</h2>
   <h3>Colleen "Lean" McCormack and Will "Willean" McCormack</h3>
   <p>3-6</p>
   <p>Somehow she is worse at crosswords than her team is at winning.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</h2>
   <h3>Sara Aloupis and Sara Aloupis' Fantasy Slave</h3>
   <p>4-5</p>
   <p>Over/under 3 weeks for the last time Sara herself opened the fantasy app.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</h2>
   <h3>Ryan Luca</h3>
   <p>3-6</p>
   <p>Can we talk about this team name? What does it imply? Is he calling himself bad? Or is he saying that Biden's speechwriter is good and complimenting himself? Or, is he merely making light of the fact that Joe Biden's speechwriter is in fact a person that exists? It's just confusing, and not very good.<p>

   <br>

   <h2>Earl Thomas' Brother</h2>
   <h3>Elvis Smuth</h3>
   <p>5-4</p>
   <p>There are only 25 blimps in the whole world.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Scrub Daddy</h2>
   <h3>Matt Kinny</h3>
   <p>7-2</p>
   <p>Jawn not only beat me in fantasy a second time, but also ate my girlfriend's bagel. SMH.</p>

   <br>

   <p>And now for your regularly scheduled programming:</p>

      <p>Remember last week when I said we're all slowly convering around the <b>20-25 point</b> range? Well, I fucking lied. This week was such a low-scoring, expectation-defying nightmare, that these deviations were sent all out of whack and completely disrupted the trends of the past few weeks. <b>Scrub Daddy's</b> deviation skyrocketed to <b>29.2</b> points, thanks to logging my lowest scoring game of the year by a massive margin. <b>Wandisimo</b> is finally evening out after logging his 5th straight sub-100 point game of the season, while <b>Wharf Rat Owner</b> is continuing to bolster his position has most consistent in the league with a deviation of <b>13.3</b>. <b>Boston Weathermen</b>, <b>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</b>, and <b>female playing</b> have entered the prophecied <b>20-25 point</b> range, so maybe things aren't out of wack as I thought they were on first glance.</p>

      <p>I really thought that ESPN would come through with one week where they hit the nail on the head, or come really close to it. I guess there's still time, but as weeks are getting crazier and crazier, I'm running out of hope for them. This week's average of <b>16.385 points</b> off of actual scores was better than recent weeks, and actually up there as one of the best of the year for ESPN, but still not too impressive. People like <b>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</b> keep giving them easy hits by starting players who are OUT, and <b>Wandisimo</b> keeps predictably scoring under <b>100 points</b>. Here's something fun! <b>Wharf Rat Owner</b> and <b>Earl Thomas Brother</b> played each other this week, and were both the same margin off of their projected scores but in opposite directions (<b>4.7 points</b> above and <b>4.7 points</b> below respectively). That's all I got. Next section.</p>

   <li><b>COOKing Dinner</b> is legitness</li>
   <li><b>Scrub Daddy</b> is hanging on by a god damn thread.</li>

   <p>Now onto our usual unluckiest loser and luckiest winner:</p>
      
   <p>This has been happening more and more recently, but we had another case of 2nd best team being matched up against the 1st place team. In an absolute nail-biter of second-floor king versus basement dweller, <b>Earl Thomas' Brother</b> eeked out with a win against <b>Wharf Rat Owner</b>, making everyone's favorite recovering poverty franchise this week's unluckiest loser.</p>
   
   <p>The luckiest win of the week has to belong to <b>Wandisimo</b>, who was only the 6th highest scorer but was fortunately matched up against the week's lowest scorer, <b>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</b>. I'd describe this matchup as two weak little boys whacking each other to death with wet pool noodles until one of them passes out from exhaustion and the other goes crying for help as he wets hi. Fun stuff!</b>

   <h1>The Fr. Linnane's Special Little Hound Award</h1>

   <p>Last week, I gave <b>COOKing Dinner</b> shit for winning this award while scoring low points, but this week's winner makes last week's performance look godly. The winner this week is the <b>EIGTH</b> unique winner of this award, meaning that only <b>Wharf Rat Owner</b> and <b>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</b> have yet to win it. Time is running out bitches. With a measly <b>116.7 points</b>, the Special Little Hound of the week is only being granted this award because none of us were good enough to beat that pathetic score. It's all of our faults that we let this travesty happen. Congrats bud.</p>
      
   <p>The Fr. Linanne's Special Little Hound of Week 8 is...</p>

   <h1>The Lou of the Week Award</h1>

      <p>The only thing less surprising than <b>Wandisimo</b> winning this award is this week's winner winning this award. They put up an embarassingly low <b>71.1 points</b>, and lost a game that they had no hope in winning from the start. Davante Parker is a curse, and his spirit will haunt your lineup for years to come. I'd feel bad, but you did this to yourself.</p>

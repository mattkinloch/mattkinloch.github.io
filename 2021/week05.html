         <h1>Washed Up Greyhounds Weekly Roundup</h1>
         <h1>Week 5</h1>

         <p>Howdy! Today I subscribed to the New York Times Crossword because that is my idea of what a sophisticated person does and I'm slowly aging with each passing day, getting one step closer to returning to the dust from which I was born, and that terrifies me. Also, I lost in fantasy after having a 60 point cushion because of course Lamar and Mandrews had to literally double the score of the entire the rest of Jack's team. Anyway, how are you guys? Send me a nice juicy emoji to know you're loving life. How about... the shrimp emoji. Don't leave me hanging guys. Please.</p>
             
         <p>Another quickie this week. Let's see how we're doing:</p>

         <p>Alright, let's get it GROOVING folks.</p>

         <br>

         <h1>&#128680;Trade Alert&#128680;</h1>
         
         <p>We have our second trade of the year, ladies and gentlemen. It's the time of year where people panic that their teams suck so they start sending out desperation trades in an attempt to salvage their years, aka my favorite time of year. There are already murmurs of Pat dealing Travis Kelce in a blockbuster like we've never seen before. I've sworn of trading this year, but I give it a few weeks before I'm offering Derrick Henry for Mike Davis and a ham sandwich. Let's take a look at this trade:</p>
         
         <table class="center">
            <tr>
               <th>Team:</th>
               <th>female playing</th>
               <th>Wandisimo</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <th>Receives:</th>
               <th>Ja'marr Chase, WR (CIN)<br></th>
               <th>Julio Jones, WR (TEN)<br>Rob Gronkowski, TE (TB)</th>
            </tr>
         </table>
         
         <p>We'll revisit this trade in a few weeks to see how it pans out as we did last time. I will remain an unbiased narrator here, but it definitely seems like someone has an early lead in winning the trade. Chase putting up <b>25 points</b> in Week 5 and the other two... not playing, is definitely telling. That being said, I'll hold off on any trade roasting for now and let the numbers do the talking later.</p>

            </tr>
            <tr>
               <th>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</th>
               <th>18.88</th>
               <th>3-2</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <th>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</th>
               <th>17.10</th>
               <th>1-4</th>

            <tr>
               <th>Earl Thomas' Brother</th>

               <th>4-1</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <th>Scrub Daddy</th>
               <th>18.77</th>
               <th>4-1</th>
            </tr>
         </table>

             <p>We're at the point where these deviations are changing only slightly from week to week now that we have a decent sample size of data to work with. <b>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</b> increased only by about .2 points, which (maybe?) confirms what I was saying last week: teams have pretty much found their identity. There are the consistent 100-120 point scorers like <b>COOKing Dinner</b> who are the most consistent and float right around the average weekly score, but can't seem to pull out wins. This is why we're also looking at luck (wow everything's coming together), because who you happen to be playing against is just about as important as how your team does.</p>
             
         <p>Speaking of <b>COOKing Dinner</b>, thank you for validating my entire existince by acknowledging my incredible understanding of this beautiful game. Hopefully this section continues to let me flex my big throbbing fantasy brain by making unfounded claims based on numbers I don't understand.</p>

         <p>We all scored above our projections! Well, all of us except one lowly team that I am now labelling the league's new poverty franchise, <b>Wandisimo</b>. Congrats <b>Wharf Rat Owner</b>, you're no longer special nor impoverished.</p>
         
         <p>This was a better week for ESPN's projections, averaging <b>19.45 points</b> off of actual scores. Still not good, but better than last week (which was their worst yet). <b>Earl Thomas' Brother</b> threw everything off kilter by going nuclear, scoring <b>39 points</b> above his projection, the biggest projection beat of the weak. On the other hand, <b>Boston Weathermen</b> scored the closest to their projection, only <b>2.5 points</b> above and also managed to win while doing it. Also, and please fact check me on this, I believe <b>Scrub Daddy</b> had the highest projected score out of any team yet this year (and still beat it). Just goes to show how cool and smart I am.</p>
         
         <br>
       
         <h1>You Got "Lucky"</h1>

         <p>I think there's been some misunderstanding as to what this section is. Our lovable little boy Smuth asked me who I was choosing for unluckiest of the week, but I don't get to choose. It's all about the numbers baby. If someone scores in the upper half and still loses by being unluckily matched up against one of the few teams who scored higher, that's our definition of unlucky. Vice versa for luckiest. Your performance has absolutely no impact on your opponents, so a huge part in whether you walk away with an L or W is whoever you were randomly matched up against. Fantasy is like putting two dudes in a room, blindfolding them, and having them jer- nevermind.</p>
         
         <p><b>Boston Weathermen</b> was the luckiest team this week, scoring third lowest with <b>123.8 points</b> but playing against the second lowest scorer <b>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</b> who posted <b>110.55 points</b>. Why'd you have to start someone who was designated OUT, buddy? Why? Especially why against the Weathermen? SMH. You were so close to glory and you blew it.</p>
             
         <p>Our unluckiest team of the week was a special little team that was bound to show up here eventually. You guessed it, it's me. <b>Scrub Daddy</b> scored 3rd highest with <b>146.3 points</b>, but got absolutely rocked by MNF and the <b>Wuhan Bats</b>. An honorable mention, because I would <i>hate</i> to hog the spotlight, is <b>female playing</b>, who scored 4th highest and was matched up against the 2nd highest scoring team <b>Earl Thomas' Brother</b>. The four top scores bunched up into only two games? It's almost impossible to get unluckier than that. Absolutely brutal for us this week.</p>

         <br>

         <h1>The Fr. Linnane's Special Little Hound Award</h1>

         <p>Our award winner this week is yet another first-time winner, and scored the highest this week by a whopping <b>20 point</b> margin. In fact, we have yet to have a repeat winner in this category, perhaps indicating the league is anyone's game? Probably not. But it's a nice thought.</p>
         <p>The Fr. Linanne's Special Little Hound of Week 5 is...</p>

         <h1>The Lou of the Week Award</h1>

         <p>This one is a little sad, I'll be honest. Winning this award twice is brutal enough as it is, but a third time? In only 5 weeks? Incredibly rough. The Lou of the Week winner posted a measly <b>85.4 points</b>, and was the only team in the league this week to finish below the century mark. That's a team deserving this award if I've ever seen one.</p>

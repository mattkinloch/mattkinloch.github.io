         <h1>Preseason Roundup</h1>
         
         <p>It's almost that beautiful time of year again. The sun is shining, the planet is dying, and people are getting murdered in the streets. Betty White is gone and she is never coming back. But none of that nonsense is nearly as important as the 4th season of our beloved fantasy football league, which for the first time ever has all league members from the previous season returning. I'm taking all the credit for that because I am simply the single best commissioner in the history of the world.</p>

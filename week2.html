   <h1>Washed Up Greyhounds Weekly Roundup</h1>
   <h1>Week 2</h1>

   <p>Hi Mommies! Welcome back to the Washed Up Greyhounds Weekly Roundup. So much has happened since we last spoke. </p>

   <h1>&#128680;Trade Alert&#128680;</h1>
   
   <p>Holy MOLY ladies and gentlemen we had ourselves the very first trade of the season this week. I'll keep this section short and sweet because if it runs too long some people will lose interest after 30 seconds (yikes).</p>
   
   <table class="center">
      <tr>
         <th>Team:</th>
         <th>Scrub Daddy (Matt Kinloch)</th>
         <th>Wharf Rat Owners (Pat Auth)</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <th>Receives:</th>
         <th>Jalen Hurts, QB (PHI)<br>Graham Gano, K (NYG)</th>
         <th>Devonta Smith, WR (PHI)<br>Younghoe Koo, K (ATL)</th>
      </tr>
   </table>
   
   <p>As weeks progress, we'll begin trying to declare winners of each trade by looking at value acquired players bring to each team based on performance of players that team is replacing.</p>

   <h1>Consistent Constituent Constitution Constipation Conflagration</h1>

   <p>Consistency is the name of the game folks. Or is it? I consistently get drunk on weekends and that doesn't seem to be doing very much for my long term aspirations. It certainly helps to deal with this stupid made up fantasy game we all agreed to play. Who even came up with fantasy? Bill "Wink" Winkenbach, that's who. Yea, I googled it. Shocking right. If Bill Winkenbach never gathered in that New York City hotel room in the late summer of '62, none of us would be in this mess. You're a rat bastard Bill Winkenbach.</p>
  
   <p>We're going to start tracking the standard deviation of each team's scores across the season, and seeing who's scores are most consistent. Maybe even more importantly than that, we're going to see if consistency translates into wins. Spoiler alert: I'm guessing the only consistency we see is one sad team consistently getting stomped.</p>

   <h1>The Lou of the Week Award</h1>

   <p>We'll cap off our weekly recap by naming one lucky team the Lou of the Week, named after our dear friend Luke aka Lou who tragically fell into Baltimore's murky harbor after an open bar at Barcocina, drowned, and was never seen again. The police conducted a thorough investigation and ultimately suspect foul play, but no one was ever charged. That night haunts my dreams and I haven't slept a full night since. Sometimes I can still hear the screams of Sam the Bartender as he saw Lou take that fatal plunge into the abyss. Sorry, I got carried away. My therapist cancelled on me this week because she had to get her headlight fluid changed. The Lou of the Week is the team who not only managed to lose, but did so in a particularly embarassing fashion by scoring the least amount of points in the week.</p>
   <p>The Lou of the Week goes to, drumroll please...</p>

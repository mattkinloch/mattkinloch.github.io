   <h1>Washed Up Greyhounds REGULAR SEASON Roundup</h1>

   <p>It's finally over. 14 weeks of hell on earth only for a lucky few of us to have to suffer for 1-3 extra weeks for nothing but bragging rights and like 200 bucks. Also, Pat hasn't paid me still smh this is your public shaming. To those eliminated, congrats, you can delete the app for 9 months now. To the rest of us, I'm sorry. When your team inevitably shits the bed and loses, just remember that fantasy is the most important thing in your life and that you should be very, very upset.</p>
   
   <p>First order of business: grieving the loss of our final fallen soldier.</p>

   <br>

   <p>In perhaps the most undeserved BYE week of all time, <b>Earl Thomas' Brother</b> gets a free pass to the second round alongside God King Emperor <b>Wuhan Bats</b>. <b>Scrub Daddy</b> will square off against the team whose name reminds him of the nightmare he's had every night for the past 5 years, <b>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</b>. <b>Boston Weathermen</b> is matched up against <b>COOKing Dinner</b> and will probably lose. On a scale of 1-10 the meltdown will be a 100.</p>

   <br>
   
   <h1>Punishment ;)</h1>
   
   <p>Let's revisit the terms of the punishment we set at the beginning of the season now that we know <b>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</b> is the one getting screwed. It worked out pretty nice that the worst team name and only league member with a punishment kink winds up the loser.</p>
   
   <p>Punishment: Mini Hot Ones Challenge</p>
   <p>Terms:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Non-losers send questions for the loser to commissioner</li>
      <li>Comissioner sends questions to the loser anonymously</li>
      <li>Commissioner sends a bottle of "Da Bomb" hot sauce to loser</li>
      <li>Loser cooks their desired amount of chicken wings</li>
      <li>Loser coats 1 (one) wing entirely in Da Bomb hot sauce</li>
      <li>Loser films themselves eating the entire wing, then answering all questions</li>
      <li>Once all questions have been answered thoroughly, loser may deal with the heat however they please</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The user will be allowed only 1 (one) glass of water OR 1 (one) glass of milk until all questions have been answered. The "loser" will be defined as the person with the least amount of wins/last in the standings after all 14 weeks of the season have concluded. If there are two teams with the same record tied for last place, the tie-breaker will be POINTS SCORED.</p>

   <p>Refusal to participate in the punishment will result in the public shaming of the loser and their immediate termination from the league. Don't be a beta cuck.</p>
   
   <p>Alright, there you have it. I'll be reaching out to <b>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</b> for delivery instructions, and to the rest of you for questions. Remember, be nice. But not too nice.</p>

   <p>I'm continuing to retire a few sections to revisit them in the Year End Review (this is just the regular season review).</p>

   <h1>The Fr. Linnane's Special Little Hound Award</h1>

   <p>The final Fr. Linnane's Special Little Hound winner won this award in a spectacular fashion, scoring the most points out of any team in any week at the very last second of the regular season, with <b>173.9 points</b>. Making himself an immense playoff threat with such a monstrous performance, I'm glad I'm not the sucker forced to play him in the first round. Sorry Cunniff, good luck.</p>
      
   <p>The Fr. Linanne's Special Little Hound of Week 10 is...</p>

   <h1>The Lou of the Week Award</h1>

      <p>In an unexpected turn of events, a top dog of the league ends up as the final Lou of the Week award winner. With a dissapointing <b>89.05 points</b>, our winner should be glad his week has a BYE week to rest up even though they actually aren't resting and will probably wind up injured for when things actually matter in 2 weeks. Oh well, not my problem.</p>

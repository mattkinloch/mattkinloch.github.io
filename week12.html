   <h1>Washed Up Greyhounds Weekly Roundup</h1>
   <h1>Week 12</h1>

   <p>Something huge has happened. Something monumental. Historic, even. Something that quite possibly could change the trajectories of each and every one of our lives without us even knowing it. That's right - the hot sauce has been ordered. The end is now in sight for some unlucky few of us as this past week really cemented the trajectory of the rest of the season for the bottom of the barrel, while making things an absolute shitshow for those of us who still have a chance. After all this chaos, only one thing remains true: Fantasy Football sucks ass. Let's see how we all did.</p>

      <p>We're reaching the end times ladies and gentleman. We've been through so many weeks that new scores barely budge our deviations, so pretty much the way things are now are how they'll stay. Unless, of course, something insane happens. I should probably just retire this section, but just like the homeless man outside the vape shop told me last night, I should "never quit steezing".</p>

      <p>Just like the race for worst Tradeswell employee between <b>Wuhan Bats</b> and <b>Earl Thomas' Brother</b>, the race for biggest dissapointment this week was very close. Our favorite  startup darlings missed their projections by a mile, by <b>36.75 points</b> and <b>31.35 points</b> respectively. Coincidentally, both have a two game cushion in their divisions BUT this better not be a trend in the next two weeks or the long-standing kings will quickly be dethroned. The biggest win of the week was <b>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</b> with a solid <b>24.85 points</b> above her projection. How did we let this happen, guys? I'm not sure she could name her starting quarterback with a gun to her head. We should be ashamed.</p>

   <p>Takeway time! Here we go:</p>
      
   <li>We thought <b>Earl Thomas' Brother</b> was the fraud because of lopsided divisions, but turns out its <b>Boston Weathermen</b> and it's not even really close.</li>
   <li><b>Scrub Daddy</b> has lost 4 games in a row and has never not had the most total points for. Insanity.</li>
   <li><b>COOKing Dinner</b> is probably going to win becuase 5th place is overpowered.</li>
   <li><b>female playing</b> deserved better. I blame <b>Boston Weathermen</b>, just because.</li>
      
   <p>In line with recent trends (i.e. 4 game losing streak), <b>Scrub Daddy</b> was the unluckiest loser this week. I posted the 5th highest score with <b>102.45 points</b> but was led like a lamb to the slaughter to the 4th highest scorer <b>COOKing Dinner</b>. Something something would have beaten more people than I would have lost to, you get the drill.</p>
   
   <p>The league's resident unluckiest team finally had a streak of luck, albeit wayyy too late. The 6th highest scorer <b>female playing</b> posted <b>99.6 points</b> and managed to walk away with a win against the league's poverty franchise <b>Wandisimo</b>. At least you are good at the crossword! (She's actually just okay, I'm only saying she's good so she doesn't feel too bad about her fantasy team. Lean don't read this.)</p>

   <p>Listen, I hate to burst your bubble, but here's how the rest of the season is going to play out: <b>Wuhan Bats</b> and <b>Earl Thomas' Brother</b> get first round byes, and <b>COOKing Dinner</b> demolishes <b>Boston Weathermen</b> in the first round while <b>Scrub Daddy</b> loses an absolute heartbreaker by <b>3-8</b> points to <b>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</b>. <b>Wuhan Bats</b> comes back off the bye week looking sluggish and loses to <b>COOKing Dinner</b>, while <b>Earl Thomas' Brother</b> somehow beats <b>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</b> because of course he does. The championship is a shit show as both teams will probably be injured to hell. It's hard to call, but I'll give it to <b>COOKing Dinner</b>. When this is exactly what happens, I better get props.</p>

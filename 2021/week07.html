   <h1>Washed Up Greyhounds Weekly Roundup</h1>
   <h1>Week 7</h1>

   <p>Wharf Rat is closing. I have nothing left to keep me going. I don't even get to feel special for being part of the mug club because now any poser can walk in and buy one for twenty bucks. I don't even want to play fantasy anymore. Anyway, welcome to the Roundup.</p>
       
   <p>For our team check-ins, I'm gonna do a fun little exercise where I decide what the 2021 NFL equivalent of each beautiful little franchise is. Let's get it going:</p>

   <h1>Introductions</h1>
   
   <h2>Wuhan Bats</h2>
   <h3>Jawn Lunch</h3>
   <p>7-0</p>
   <p>Somehow undefeated even though they definitely shouldn't be? Arizona Cardinals.</p>   
   <br>

   <h2>Wharf Rat Owners</h2>
   <h3>Patrick Authority</h3>
   <p>2-5</p>
   <p>Recovering poverty franchise that had some hope but dissapoints... Miami Dolphins</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Wandisimo</h2>
   <h3>Colin Burke</h3>
   <p>2-5</p>
   <p>History of success, coasted off of it and sucks now. Denver Broncos.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>COOKing Dinner</h2>
   <h3>Andrew Fallus</h3>
   <p>2-5</p>
   <p>Looked like all the pieces were in place, but continually got fucked, unlucky, or underperformed. New Orleans Saints?</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Boston Weathermen</h2>
   <h3>Matthew James Cunniff</h3>
   <p>4-3</p>
   <p>Is technically capable of winning games but holds itself back consistently. Seattle Seahawks.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>female playing</h2>
   <h3>Colleen "Lean" McCormack and Will "Willean" McCormack</h3>
   <p>2-5</p>
   <p>No one wants to see them lose but it's the only thing they're good at. Detroit Lions.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</h2>
   <h3>Sara Aloupis and Sara Aloupis' Fantasy Slave</h3>
   <p>4-3</p>
   <p>Will either miss playoffs by one game, or lose instantly if they do. Indianapolis Colts.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</h2>
   <h3>Ryan Luca</h3>
   <p>2-5</p>
   <p>Jacksonville Jaguars. Should not need an explanation.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Earl Thomas' Brother</h2>
   <h3>Elvis Smuth</h3>
   <p>4-3</p>
   <p>Does a ton of research and analytics, overthinks things, and would still lose even if they didn't. San Francisco 49ers.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Scrub Daddy</h2>
   <h3>Matt Kinny</h3>
   <p>6-1</p>
   <p>On the path to greatness but destined to choke at the last second. Green Bay Packers.</p>

   <br>

   <p>I hope you're glad I didn't make any of you the Jets or Texans. On with the recap! </p>

   <br>

   <h1>&#128680;Trade Alert&#128680;</h1>
   
   <p>Alright, time to reflect on a trade, and oh boy is it a rough one. A team that in the past would caution others to not trade with them was forced to eat its own words, finding themselves a victim of highway robbery by a league newcomer. Let's remind ourselves what went down:</p>
   
   <table class="center">
      <tr>
         <th>Team:</th>
         <th>female playing</th>
         <th>Wandisimo</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <th>Receives:</th>
         <th>Ja'marr Chase, WR (CIN)<br></th>
         <th>Julio Jones, WR (TEN)<br>Rob Gronkowski, TE (TB)</th>
      </tr>
   </table>
   
   <p>This is what engineering experts in the scientific community, such as myself, would describe as a "ruh roh". In the 3 weeks since the trade, Ja'marr Chase emerged as an early Rookie of the Year candidate, contributed <b>66.7 points</b> to <b>female playing</b>'s lineup, and is currently sitting as the second best WR in fantasy on the year. On the other hand, Julio Jones was OUT and then dropped, and Rob Gronkowski was... OUT. This trade is so one-sided that I almost want to invoke collusion, but instead I will just enjoy shitting on the terrible trade. Congrats <b>female playing</b>, you fleeced this man.</p>

   <br>
       
   <h1>Consistent Constipation</h1>
       
   <p>Another week, another boring consistency section.</p>

      <p><b>20 points</b> continues to be the magic number here, as we're all slowly inching towards that. Interestingly, the only person who veered in the opposite direction of 20 is <b>Wharf Rat Owner</b>, who seems to have gotten their shit together and is consistenly putting up around <b>110 points</b> a week. If this section meant anything that would be great, but sadly it doesn't, and your team is still bad. <b>Wandisimo</b> stil deviates more than everyone else by about <b>10 points</b>, which seems off because he's posted 3 consecutive sub-100 point weeks, and 4 in total. I suspect this will plummet with a few more weeks.</p>

      <p>ESPN had their best week of projections! A somewhat respectable average of <b>14.06 points</b> off of actual scores made for a pretty good showing, however there are some pretty big caveats. The projections cheated a bit, thanks to <b>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</b>, as they knew that Davante Parker would post <b>0 points</b> ahead of time. Because of this, I won't give them too much credit, and will take this opportunity to once again call <b>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</b> a clown for leaving him in his lineup.</p>
	  
	  <p>The biggest miss this week was <b>Wandisimo</b> who finished <b>-39.6 points</b> off of their projection, which has to be up there with one of the worst of the season. In the opposite direction, <b>female playing</b> overshot her projection by <b>34.75 points</b> in a much needed season-saving win. <b>Wharf Rat Owner</b> came shockingly close to their projection, off by only <b>0.35 points</b>. Good job being predictable!</p>

   <p>One more time through the quick takeways:</p>
      
   <li><b>female playing</b>'s luck is turning around slowly.</li>
   <li><b>Earl Thomas' Brother</b> is only making playoffs because of his division.</li>
   <li><b>COOKing Dinner</b> stays unlucky.</li>
   <li><b>Scrub Daddy</b> is STILL king.</li>

   <p>Now onto our usual unluckiest loser and luckiest winner:</p>
      
   <p>Fantasy Football is a stupid game. The 7th highest scorer this week, <b>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</b>, beat the 8th highest scoring team this week, <b>COOKing Dinner</b>, by exactly <b>2 points</b> and with an OUT player in his starting line up. Luckiest bastard of the week, and I'm upset.</p>
      
   <p>Not <i>incredibly</i> unlucky, but now that we're deep into the season every week matters and slightly unlucky losses feel worse and worse. <b>Wharf Rat Owner</b>, who was the 5th highest scorer, was unfortunately matched up against the 3rd highest scorer <b>Boston Weathermen</b> and walked away with an L. It's rough stuff to know you would have beaten more people than you would have lost to, but luckily I'm here to ruin your day.</p>

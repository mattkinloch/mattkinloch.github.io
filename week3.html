   <h1>Washed Up Greyhounds Weekly Roundup</h1>
   <h1>Week 3</h1>

   <p>Good Morning Greyhounds! Today in Baltimore, MD, it is 63 degress with a high of 82. Thre is no chance of rain for the rest of the day. And it should be a relatively warm evening, only dropping down to 66 degrees. In Hartford, CT, it is a little chil-Tom Brady. Tom Brady. Tom Brady. Deloitte. Boston Calling. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.</p>
   
   <p>Wh- what just happened to me? I sat down to write this week's roundup and then woke up on the floor ass-naked, clutching a box of cheeseless pizza. Everything feels different. I feel... a little shorter. 20 pounds lighter too. I can't think straight. I tried to recite the alphabet but I kept screaming out weather in Denver. I'm scared.</p>
   
   <p>Anyway, anyone like riddles? Here's one: take the common abbreviation for a major US city, and put it inbetween the airport code for that city's airport. You should end up with a flower. Whoever guesses it first get's a free pack of Zyns. I mean a free pack of Zyns. No, a free pack of Zyns. What is happening? I can't say anything except "pack of Zyns". Wait... Boston, Tom Brady, the weather, Zyns??? It's like I'm possessed by... oh God.</p>
       
   <p>Before I run to the local Fells Point exorcist, let's check in with our stupid dumb leaguemates:

   <h1>Introductions</h1>
   
   <h2>Wuhan Bats</h2>
   <h3>Jawn Lunch</h3>
   <p>3-0</p>
   <p>John F. Kennedy reincarnated, but slightly worse.</p>   
   <br>

   <h2>Wharf Rat Owners</h2>
   <h3>Patrick Authority</h3>

   <br>

   <p>Alright, let's get it going folks.</p>

   <br>

   <h1>&#128680;Trade Alert&#128680;</h1>
   
   <p>Let's take a crack at seeing how this Boston is panning out after 2 weeks. Shoot, I mean how this trade is panning out. Here's what was traded, as a reminder:</p>
   
   <table class="center">
      <tr>
         <th>Team:</th>
         <th>Scrub Daddy (Matt Kinloch)</th>
         <th>Wharf Rat Owners (Pat Auth)</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <th>Receives:</th>
         <th>Jalen Hurts, QB (PHI)<br>Graham Gano, K (NYG)</th>
         <th>Devonta Smith, WR (PHI)<br>Younghoe Koo, K (ATL)</th>
      </tr>
   </table>
   
       <p>In the 2 weeks since the trade, <b>Scrub Daddy</b> has gone 2-0 and <b>Wharf Rat Owner</b> has gone 0-2. <b>Wharf Rat Owner</b> started Devonta Smith in Week 2 and benched him in Week 3, contributing a total of <b>2.6 points</b> to his lineup. Smith replaced Robby Anderson in his lineup, resulting in a value of <b>-2.7 points</b>, as Anderson outscored Smith in the week Smith was started. Younhoe Koo started in Week 2 and scored <b>5 points</b>, replacing Graham Gano who scored <b>22 points</b> in Week 2. That amounts to <b>-17 points</b> in value, for a total of <b>-19.7 points</b> over 2 weeks for the trade. <b>Scrub Daddy</b> started Jalen Hurts in both Week 2 and 3, contributing a total of <b>47.5 points</b> to his lineup. Hurts replaced Tua Tagovailoa, who scored <b>0.65 points</b> over 2 weeks after a Week 2 injury. This resulted in a <b>46.85 point</b> value for <b>Scrub Daddy's</b> lineup. I'll let you interpret the winner so far for yourselves ;)</p>

   <br>

   <h1>Consistent Constipation</h1>

   <p>What do you guys think happens after we die? I think there's nothing except a terrifying void of blackness for etern-FUCK YOU DON'T ATTACK MY TERRITORY JACK!!! YOU'RE A SCUMBAG TRAITOR!!!!</p>
       
   <p>I can't handle this anymore. Everything I try to say gets interrupted by Cunniffisms. I couldn't even sleep last night. All I heard was Cunniff's maniacal laugh in the distance, like some sick and twisted version of tinnitus. I don't know how much longer I can take this. I feel myself slowly becoming him. My hair gets blonder by the day. I feel compelled to pay attention to the stock market. I need this hell to stop.</p>
   
   <p>While there's still a little bit of me left, let's check in on consistency once more:</p>

<table class="center">
      <tr>
         <th>Team</th>
         <th>Std Dev</th>
         <th>Record</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <th>Wuhan Bats</th>
         <th>16.19</th>
         <th>3-0</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <th>Whart Rat Owner</th>
         <th>6.08</th>
         <th>0-3</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <th>Wandisimo</th>
         <th>32.54</th>
         <th>1-2</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <th>COOKing Dinner</th>
         <th>6.35</th>
         <th>1-2</th>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <th>Boston Weathermen</th>
         <th>32.74</th>
         <th>1-2</th>
         
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <th>female playing</th>
         <th>10.57</th>
         <th>1-2</th>
         <th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <th>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</th>
         <th>22.34</th>
         <th>1-2</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <th>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</th>
         <th>21.61</th>
         <th>1-2</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <th>Earl Thomas' Brother</th>
         <th>8.15</th>
         <th>3-0</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <th>Scrub Daddy</th>
         <th>23.65</th>
         <th>3-0</th>
      </tr>
   </table>

       <p>Pretty much some more of the same here. <b>Wharf Rat Owner</b> is consistently bad (sorry). Other teams with similarly low deviations in score like <b>COOKing Dinner</b> and <b>female playing</b> find themselves with losing records. The one outlier here is <b>Earl Thomas' Brother</b>, with the second lowest deviation in score and an undefeated record. Don't worry though, <b>Scrub Daddy</b> will put an end to that next week in the battle for 4-0.</p>

   <h1>ESPN Sucks</h1>

   <p>My fake therapist said I made a lot of progress this week. I showed her the absolutely knee-slap-worthy relatable humor in last week's ESPN Sucks section, and she laughed harder than anyone I'd ever seen anyone laugh before. It must have been even more relatable than I thought, because she doesn't even know you guys. It's almost like she'll validate anything I think or feel because she's completely imaginary and will do whatever I want. Idk tho, the section <i>was</i> pretty funny. She also told me to stop buying homeless people cigarettes and instead do something more productive for them like buy them a house, but idk I think she's in cahoots with the homeless guy.</p>

   <p>Anyway, here's more of this projection bullshit no one cares about. Cunniff stole my whole idea anyway. And possessed me. Tuesdays, am I right guys?</p>

   <p>ESPN's projections were off by an average of <b>14.325 points</b>. That's their best yet, but I won't be even slightly impressed until they're hitting single digits there, and doing so consistently. <b>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</b> beat their projection by the widest margin this week, with <b>31.6 points</b>. If that was a dollar for every point, you could get like, 15 cups of Rofo queso. <b>Wuhan Bats</b> nearly drove ESPN's projection guy to suicide this week, by underscoring his expected score by <b>22.55 points</b>.</p>
    
   <p>Stuff like this makes me wonder... are we the problem? Is it our responsibility to score what ESPN projects us to? Have we even considered the effect that missing projects by a mile has on morale at ESPN? These are hardworking people, and we're letting them down.</p>

   <h1>You Got "Lucky"</h1>

   <p>What's the point anymore. I stay up past my bedtime of 10:00pm every Monday to do these stupid little roundups that no one even reads. I just wanted to do something fun for my friends and all they do is ignore my hard work and laugh as a I cry myself to sleep every night. I could probably just copy and paste 5 pages from <i>War and Peace</i> with some tables thrown in and no one would even notice.</p>
   
   <p>This section of the roundup got the kick in the ass it needed, ladies and gentlemen. For the first time in Washed Up Greyhounds Weekly Roundup HISTORY, we had a TRULY lucky win. By a margin of <b>0.85 points</b> and with only the 8th highest score of the week, <b>Earl Thomas' Brother</b> squeeked out with a win after a Monday night nailbiter (for fantasy, the game itself sucked). He was extremely lucky he matched up with the dead-in-the-water franchise <b>Wandisimo</b>.</p>
       
       <p>We had two pretty equally unlucky teams lose this week, with <b>COOKing Dinner</b> and <b>female playing</b> scoring 4th and 5th highest respectively, and still losing. Sucks to be matched up with a flawless franchise like <b>Scrub Daddy</b> or a somewhat less good but still respectable team like <b>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</b>.</p>
   
   <p>Hopefully you fell for the pity party in the intro of this section and kept reading. Now that you've made it this far, you might as well finish out strong and see our weekly award winners. Okay bye love youuuuu.</p>

   <h1>The Fr. Linnane's Special Little Hound Award</h1>

   <p>Really Fr.? This guy? Out of everyone in the league? All of these beautiful little teams and you went and blessed <i>this</i> one with the highest score of the week? You picked an absolute banger of a winner last week, you should do that more often. I mean I kinda understand but... whatever. I guess just like in fantasy, every week can't be a winner. I won't doubt your judgement. </p>
   <p>The Fr. Linanne's Special Little Hound of Week 3 is...</p>
   <h2>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</h2>
   <h3>Ryan Luca</h3>

   <p>Congrats, you sucked the least!</p>

   <h1>The Lou of the Week Award</h1>

   <p>I haven't slept in weeks. Between this untimely possession, my constant therapy sessions, and writing this roundup, I haven't been myself lately. Not to mention that whenever I do manage to sleep, my nightmares are plagued with visions of Lou. I had another last night. It was so surreal - I was going on my nightly walk around the Fells waterfront, and stopped at the spot where Lou sunk. I took a seat, legs dangling over the edge, trying not to lose a sandal to the water. If one fell, I'd never get it back. Just like Lou. I noticed some bubbles directly below me, dancing around the water's surface. I leaned in a bit closer, and the bubbles rapidly expanded. I slowly started to make something out through the murkiness of the water. It was... Lou. His body surfaced after all these months. I sprung up and grabbed my phone, ready to call the cops. I got hold of the 911 operator, and turned towards the street to give them my location. "Corner of Broadway and Thames", I said hurriedly. Then it happened. I felt a presence behind me. It was Lou. His bloated, water-logged corpse had risen from the water. It stunk like a pig. It stood there for a few moments, and croaked out two words: "Tom... Brady...".</p>
       
   <p>Wait.</p>
       
   <p>It's starting to make sense. These nightmares, the possession... both started around the same time and both mentioned Tom Brady. Does that mean - no. No, it can't be. Cunniff couldn't have murdered Lou, right? Is Lou trying to warn me in my dreams? It adds up though... the officers did suspect foul play, and I can't remember where Cunniff was when Lou took the plunge. Is this why Cunniff is possessing me? Because he knew I'd eventually find out? I need to get to the bottom of this.</p>
       
   <p>The Lou of the Week is... A TIE? HOLY SHIT. I didn't think this would happen. I guess... both people win? Should there be a tie breaker? Fuck it, both teams suck and deserve this high honor.</p>
   <h2>Wandisimo</h2>
   <h3>Colin Burke</h3>
   
   <p>and</p>
   
   <h2>Boston Weathermen</h2>
   <h3>Matthew James Cunniff</h3>
   
   <p>Congrats, you (both) suck!</p>

   <h1>ESPN Sucks</h1>

   <p>If I put Milk in a room with a couple keyboards on the ground and asked him to write an algorithm to predict each team's final score each week, I guarantee he'd do a better job than whoever ESPN overpays. In this section, we'll take a look at the worst projections ESPN came out with, and just how wrong they over or under shot it.</p>

   <h1>You Got "Lucky"</h1>

   <p>What is "luck"? Is there a small little green leperchaun that prances around the end of a rainbow sprinkling magical dust around the world making people lucky? Is it merely an invention of salty schoolground children used to explain why the got fucking bodied by Kevin at first base in kickball? Probably somewhere in between. For our intents and purpose, we'll define a "lucky" win as scoring worse than the rest of the league in a week, but still managing to walk away with a big fat "W". An "unlucky" loss mean a team scored better than most of the league that week, but still managed to lose. To calculate this, I'm going to take the average score across the league for each week then compare all of the losing team's scores to it to determine who was the "unluckiest", and vice versa for the "luckiest".</p>


   <h1>The Fr. Linnane's Special Little Hound Award</h1>

   <p>The Fr. Linnane's Special Little Hound Award will be awarded weekly to the team who somehow got their shit together enough to score the most points in a given week! This is a prestigious award, and have the honor of being crowned winner by Fr. Linnane himself.</p>

   <h1>The Lou of the Week Award</h1>

   <p>We'll cap off our weekly recap by naming one lucky team the Lou of the week, named after our dear friend Luke aka Lou who tragically fell into Baltimore's harbor after an open bar at Barcocina, drowned, and was never seen again. The police conducted a thorough investigation and ultimately suspect foul play, but no one was ever charged. The Lou of the Week is the team who not only managed to lose, but did so in a particularly embarassing fashion by scoring the least amount of points in the week.</p>
   <p>The Lou of the Week goes to, drumroll please...</p>

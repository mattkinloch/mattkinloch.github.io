   <h1>Washed Up Greyhounds Weekly Roundup</h1>
   <h1>Week 8</h1>

   <p>The week of reckoning arrived. No longer is anyone in this shitshow of a league undefeated. First round picks dropped like flies, tears were shed, dreams were crushed. Now it's truly anyone's game. Let's make sure everyone's still breathing:</p>

   <h1>Introductions</h1>
   
   <h2>Wuhan Bats</h2>
   <h3>Jawn Lunch</h3>
   <p>7-1</p>
   <p>Record is directly tied to whether the Cardinals win or lose.</p>   
   <br>

   <h2>Wharf Rat Owners</h2>
   <h3>Patrick Authority</h3>
   <p>3-5</p>
   <p>About to be the Earl Thomas to Earl Thomas' Brother.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Wandisimo</h2>
   <h3>Colin Burke</h3>
   <p>2-6</p>
   <p>ruh roh.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>COOKing Dinner</h2>
   <h3>Andrew Fallus</h3>
   <p>3-5</p>
   <p>Has more "points for" than anyone in the West, but is last in the East :(</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Boston Weathermen</h2>
   <h3>Matthew James Cunniff</h3>
   <p>5-3</p>
   <p>What's more impressive, his record or him not doing anything worth roasting this weekend?</p>

   <br>

   <h2>female playing</h2>
   <h3>Colleen "Lean" McCormack and Will "Willean" McCormack</h3>
   <p>2-6</p>
   <p>Took 8 weeks, but finally learned that the good players go in your lineup and not your bench.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</h2>
   <h3>Sara Aloupis and Sara Aloupis' Fantasy Slave</h3>
   <p>4-4</p>
   <p>Idk why no one is talking about how Nancy Pelosi is lowkey kinda a baddie.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</h2>
   <h3>Ryan Luca</h3>
   <p>3-5</p>
   <p>I had to triple check this guy was actually 3-5. I wrote this whole thing thinking he was 1-7 and had to go back and change it all.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Earl Thomas' Brother</h2>
   <h3>Elvis Smuth</h3>
   <p>4-4</p>
   <p>Certified mid.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Scrub Daddy</h2>
   <h3>Matt Kinny</h3>
   <p>7-1</p>
   <p>Guaranteed to lose out, finish 7-7, and exit in the first round of playoffs.</p>

   <br>

   <p>Things around the league are spicier than ever. Let's keep it rolling.</p>

      <p><b>20-25 points</b> seems like it'll wind up being the range we all end up in rather than the <b>15-20 point</b> range I was estimating earlier in the season. <b>Wharf Rat Owner</b> is the most consistent, and that seems to be paying off as the season progresses when it seemed to be a curse earlier on. <b>Wandisimo</b> is an insanely safe bet to score sub-100 points and lose (has done so 4 times in a row now), but this has yet to even out his deviation. <b>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</b> has similar deviations to successful teams, but for whatever reason is trapped in the league's basement and hasn't seen the light of day in weeks. <b>Scrub Daddy</b>'s deviation spiked by <b>4 points</b> which is pretty significant this deep into the season, and was due to having his worst week by about <b>15 points</b> (but still managed to stay over 100 points. Yeah, he's so good and cool.)</p>

      <p>ESPN had a much better week than I expected after seeing all the abominations in score I saw when putting this together. Nearly the entire league didn't even come close to beating their projections, and the one's that did, didn't do it by much. I felt a great sense of shame looking at <b>Scrub Daddy</b> coming <b>34.95 points</b> short, but I immediately felt better after seeing <b>Wandisimo</b> come <b>45.15 points</b> short. <b>COOKing Dinner</b> and <b>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</b> came the closest to their projected scores, finishing <b>1.05 points</b> and <b>0.6 points</b> above respectively. The biggest beat was <b>Earl Thomas' Brother</b>, but he lost so haha.</p>

   <p>One more time through the quick takeways:</p>
      
   <li><b>Earl Thomas' Brother</b> is somewhat less of a fraud.</li>
   <li><b>Wandisimo</b> is worse than we thought.</li>
   <li><b>COOKing Dinner</b>'s luck turning it around?</li>
   <li><b>Scrub Daddy</b> is about to plummet.</li>

   <p>Now onto our usual unluckiest loser and luckiest winner:</p>
      
   <p><b>Wharf Rat Owner</b> had a hell of a week, beating out the first seed <b>Wuhan Bats</b> by a mere <b>0.5 points</b>, and that wasn't where his luck stopped. He was only the 7th highest scorer in the league, and was lucky enough to catch <b>Wuhan Bats</b> on a very down week as the 8th highest scorer. <b>Wharf Rat Owner</b> is coming for your ass, <b>Earl Thomas' Brother</b>, watch out.</p>
      
   <p>It's happened once again, ladies and gentleman. The second highest scorer, <b>Earl Thomas' Brother</b>, was matched up against the highest scorer <b>COOKing Dinner</b> and was forced to walk away with an incredibly painful L. I've been in his shoes, so I won't make fun of him. Actually, yes I will. Hahahahahaha get fucked bud.</p>

   <h1>The Fr. Linnane's Special Little Hound Award</h1>

   <p>It's actually impressive how we've had 7 different winners of this award after 8 weeks. Only one person has won twice (you guessed it - it's me and my plump bumbum), which is night and day from the Lou of the Week Award. This week's debut winner has had a pretty rough go of things, but hopefully for them, this is a sign of better things to come. I will give them one small knock, noting that their <b>133.15 points</b> is the lowest posted by any Fr. Linnane's Special Little Hound winner.</p>
      
   <p>The Fr. Linanne's Special Little Hound of Week 8 is...</p>

   <p>Congrats, you sucked the least!</p>

      <p>This has transcended being sad at this point. It's just depressing. I can't even think of new ways to make fun of this team. Honestly, we all know who it is, so why even wait to reveal them. It's <b>Wandisimo</b>. Sigh.</p>

   <p>Things are getting juciy. <b>Wuhan Bats</b> and <b>Scrub Daddy</b>, who previously seemed immortal, have finally shown some drops of blood. Underdogs and former poverty franchises like <b>Wharf Rat Owner</b> and <b>COOKing Dinner</b> are slowly climbing the ranks, while middle of the pack teams like <b>Earl Thomas' Brother</b> and <b>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</b> are fighting to hold their ground. 6 more regular season games left, and everyone counts. Let's see how it goes.</p>

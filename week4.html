   <h1>Washed Up Greyhounds Weekly Roundup</h1>
   <h1>Week 4</h1>

   <p>Hello Hounds. I'll be honest with you guys. I don't wanna do this shit anymore. I was gonna do this whole bit where Cunniff writes the roundup this week pretending like he's possessing me, but that was my sleep-deprived Monday night idea last week and I just don't have it in me anymore. Just like every thing else I've ever done in my life, I was super into it for like a week or 2 and now I don't care and it's basically just a chore. But I must persevere because I know how much you guys depend on me to bring joy into your lives.</p>
       
   <p>I'll make it quick this week. Let's see how everyone's doing a quarter-ish into the season:</p>

   <h1>Introductions</h1>
   
   <h2>Wuhan Bats</h2>
   <h3>Jawn Lunch</h3>
   <p>4-0</p>
   <p>World's biggest oatmeal enthusiast.</p>   
   <br>

   <h2>Wharf Rat Owners</h2>
   <h3>Patrick Authority</h3>
   <p>1-3</p>
   <p>Ruined the fun of a potential 0-17 team by actually winning.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Wandisimo</h2>
   <h3>Colin Burke</h3>
   <p>2-2</p>
   <p>Fuck Tyreek for making this team look good.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>COOKing Dinner</h2>
   <h3>Andrew Fallus</h3>
   <p>1-3</p>
   <p>1-3 means it's time to send out panic trades and hope for the best, bud.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Boston Weathermen</h2>
   <h3>Matthew James Cunniff</h3>
   <p>1-3</p>
   <p>No one trade this man a TE and let's all watch him suffer.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>female playing</h2>
   <h3>Colleen "Lean" McCormack</h3>
   <p>1-3</p>
   <p>Last in the standings, first in our hearts.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</h2>
   <h3>Sara Aloupis and Sara Aloupis' Fantasy Slave</h3>
   <p>2-2</p>
   <p>Weather report's #1 fan.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</h2>
   <h3>Ryan Luca</h3>
   <p>1-3</p>
   <p>Stop starting Jamaal Williams please bro.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Earl Thomas' Brother</h2>
   <h3>Elvis Smuth</h3>
   <p>3-1</p>
   <p>Kyle Pitts 47th overall is looking like a sizeable oof.</p>

   <br>

   <h2>Scrub Daddy</h2>
   <h3>Matt Kinny</h3>
   <p>4-0</p>
   <p>Probably not making playoffs because this game sucks.</p>

   <br>

   <p>Alright, let's get it going folks.</p>

   <br>

       <p>We're all kinda converging around roughly <b>~18-20 points</b>, except <b>Wandisimo</b>, who live or die by the Patty/Reek stack, and <b>Boston Weathermen</b> who live or die by the Russ/Lockett stack. <b>Wharf Rat Owner's</b> deviation almost doubled due to him finally winning a game, which should be very embarassing for <b>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</b>. Almost no team scores consistently high, so when a team does go nuclear these numbers spike. That seems to be why someone like <b>female playing</b>, who has yet to post a score higher than <b>130 points</b>, is seeing consistency but not results.</p>

   <p>ESPN's projections were off by an average of <b>17.525 points</b>. Slightly worse than last week (their best week), and about on par with what they've done so far this year. We had one of the biggest misses of the year so far, with ESPN forgetting <b>Boston Weathermens'</b> true nature. On the other hand, they also had their closest projection (don't fact check me) with <b>Scrub Daddy</b>, being off by only half a point. Interestingly, <b>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</b> came the closest to their projection this week than they ever have before, perhaps signalling ESPN has developed a better understanding of their team and its trends. We'll continue to see if this keeps up as we play more fake sports.</p>

   <h1>You Got "Lucky"</h1>

   <p>The point of this section was to rub salt in wounds, and I feel like I haven't fostered that sort of environment well enough. Let's get some juices flowing, eh folks?</p>
   
   <p><b>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</b> had the pleasure of being matched up with one of THREE teams (<b>Earl Thomas' Brother, female playing</b>, and <b>Boston Weathermen</b>) that scored under 100 points this week (yikes), walking away with a win while scoring only the 6th most points. This was a vital week for our girl Nancy and she pulled through, keeping her dreams alive by bouncing back to .500.</p>
       
   <p>Our unluckiest team of the week finds themselves on this list for the second time in a row, with <b>COOKing Dinner</b> posting the 4th highest score and still losing to the 3rd highest scoring team <b>Wuhan Bats</b>. Deebo Samuel just <i>had</i> to do what Deebo Samuel does and have one explosive week before fading into obscurity for the rest of the season the week you played him, right? I've always believed 1-3 is the worst record to start with in fantasy, let's see if your luck turns around.</p>

   <h1>The Fr. Linnane's Special Little Hound Award</h1>

   <p>I hate to do it, guys. I really do. But Fr. left me no choice. After posting the lowest score in the league TWICE in just 3 weeks, this team managed to drag themselves out of the gutter and put up the most points in Week 4, with a pretty impressive <b>152.6 points</b>. Brian L works in mysterious ways.</p>
   <p>The Fr. Linanne's Special Little Hound of Week 4 is...</p>

   <p>Congrats, you sucked the least!</p>

   <h1>The Lou of the Week Award</h1>

   <p>This award, on the other hand, makes me feel something special very deep down. I've never felt like this before. Is it... happiness? Perhaps. After sharing the Lou of the Week stage last roundup, this team got greedy for the lime light and booted his co-star off stage. This team managed to put up the lowest score out of any week yet, in part thanks to Logan Thomas accepting my Venmo and faking an injury to put up a goose egg. I guess you could say the weather was... bad.</p>

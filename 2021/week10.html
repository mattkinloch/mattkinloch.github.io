         <h1>Washed Up Greyhounds Weekly Roundup</h1>
         <h1>Week 10</h1>

         <p>What is happening to us? That was some of the sloppiest fantasy football I've seen in all my days. It was a brutal week with some absolutely soul-crushing losses, and to make it all worse, you fucks are demanding things from me now. You want me to make <i>graphs</i>? Listen buddy, I'm not a fucking stats major. But you know what? I'll do it just for you, because that's how much I care. But I'm not labelling my axes, I'm not a freak. Big Daddy always delivers.</p>

            <p>It's genuinely impressive how <b>Wharf Rat Owner</b> has managed to be the only one of us who's deviation in score has actually improved as the weeks have gotten more and more unpredictable and injury-ridden. His overall deviation of <b>11.95 points</b> is by far the lowest in the league, and it's finally resulting in his climbing of the standings. <b>Scrub Daddy</b> on the other hand, has shit the bed completely, as my deviation skyrocked to the worst in the league with <b>27.7 points</b> due to losing my first TWO draft picks for the season, and also TWO of my starters putting up zero points this week. I don't deserve this cruelty.</p>

            <p>In a week where all but one managed to fall short of their projections, ESPN managed a decent week averaging <b>16.08 points</b> off of actual scores. The one team that beat their projections, <b>Wuhan Bats</b> did so by a wide <b>21.6 point</b> margin. That team is a WAGON, even though I hate to admit it.

         <li><b>Wharf Rat Owner</b> can't say he's unlucky, whatever happens.</li>
         <li><b>Wandisimo</b> and <b>Joe Biden's Speechwriter</b> are right where they belong.</li>
         <li><b>Scrub Daddy</b>'s first 8 weeks are made even more impressive considering recent failures.</li>

         <p>Hey Nancy, I'll have the usual. (Nancy is a made-up waitress at a made-up local diner, and the usual is the usual luckiest winner and unluckiest loser, in case you didn't get it).</p>
            
         <p>It's a safe bet at this point that <b>female playing</b> will suffer at some point in any given fantasy week, and this time that suffering came in the form of being the unluckiest loser! With the 5th highest score of <b>103.15 points</b>, she was unfortunately matched up against the next highest scorer <b>Wharf Rat Owner</b>. I'd roast her, but her asking "Is it too late to back out of our fantasy league" says it all.</p>
         
         <p>The luckiest win of the week is one that is incredibly hard for me to talk about, as last night I was crying and punching the air in the dark as I watched it unfold. <b>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</b>, the 6th highest scorer of the week, was lucky to be matched up against the 7th highest scorer <b>Scrub Daddy</b>, beating him by just <b>1.3 FUCKING points</b>. TJ Hockenson and the Rams D are rat bastards. 0 points from both of them??? 1 sack all game for a defense with Aaron Donald and Von Miller on it playing against Jimmy God Damn G. I hate fantasy football.</b>

         <h1>The Lou of the Week Award</h1>

            <p>Every few days I'll take my one bathroom break of the day to go check my phone, and I see 3 or 4 texts from a certain someone. "My team sucks" they say, or perhaps "I'm going to lose out the season". For once, the sender was actually right, and found themselves putting up the lowest score out of any team this week. <b>90.95 points</b> is far from the lowest score of the year, but performances like that this late into the year won't get you very far. Also, with this win, our winner slides up to having the 2nd most Lou of the Week wins on the year. Woo for them!</p>

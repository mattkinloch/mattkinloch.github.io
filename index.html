         <h1>Preseason Roundup</h1>
         
         <p>Holy FUCK it's almost that beautiful time of year again. The sun is shining, the planet is dying, and people are getting murdered in the streets. Betty White is gone and she is never coming back. But none of that nonsense is nearly as important as the 4th season of our beloved fantasy football league, which <s>for the first time ever has all league members from the previous season returning</s> has all but one member returning. Inserting himself into the new gaping hole in our league is the one and only volo soccer legend <b>Victor</b>. We are no longer all Greyhounds but I'm not changing the league name god damn it. The rest of this shitty ass writeup will be reviewing league rules and establishing the punishment so none of you fucks can complain that it "wasn't agreed upon before the season started" or that "getting shot in the foot is too harsh".</p>
		 
		 <p>P.S. compliment the redesigned and revamped website RIGHT NOW or I'll never forgive you.</p>
		 
		 <h1>Draft Day</h1>
		 
		 <p>The draft is scheduled for exactly one week before the first game on<b>Thursday, September 1st at 8:00pm</b>. Please let me know as soon as possible if you can't make it, I don't want anyone auto-drafting this year.</p>
		 
		 <h1>Draft Order</h1>
		 
		 <p>I used ESPN's randomize order button. No complaining allowed.</p>
		 
		 <ol>
			<li>Pat</li>
			<li>Matt</li>
			<li>Lean</li>
			<li>Andrew</li>
			<li>Jawn</li>
			<li>Elvis</li>
			<li>Cunniff</li>
			<li>Ryan</li>
			<li>Victor</li>
			<li>Sara</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h1>Buy-In</h1>
		
		<p>I was hoping we'd go big or go home this year but some of you are scared litle dweebs so the buy-in for the league will be a somewhat respectable $25 dollars. If you feel particularly strongly that it should be higher or lower voice your concerns now or forever hold your peace. Venmo @Matt-Kinloch before/on draft day.</p>
         
		 <h1>League Rules</h1>
		 
		 <p>Scoring format will be <b>0.5 PPR</b>. Roster size is 14: 9 starters, 4 bench slots, 1 IR slot. Starters are 1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 1 Flex, 1 D/ST, 1 K. I'm open to making it 3 WR if some of you are feeling saucy. Everything is pretty standard so this section is useless.</p>

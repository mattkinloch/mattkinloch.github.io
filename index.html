   <h1>Washed Up Greyhounds Weekly Roundup</h1>
   <h1>Week 1</h1>

   <p>Hi Mommies! Welcome to the Washed Up Greyhounds Weekly Roundup hosted by none other than your commissioner Matt aka Kinny aka Kummy. Each week until I get bored of doing it or forget, we'll take a peep at who got luckiest and unluckiest, who's team shit the bed the most, and how garbage ESPN's projections are. There's not much to work with only one week in, but as some juicy numbers roll in throughout the following weeks we'll get more interesting stats going. Something something tighten the box, Tradeswell bad, Connecticut is not in New England.</p>
   <p>P.S. A little birdie told me some awards might be given out if you stick around ;)</p>
   <p> Before we get started, let's go through a quick introduction of all our beautiful leaguemates: </p>

   <p> God DAMN what a lineup we have here folks. Hope you're all ready for 18 whole weeks of rage, group chat spam, and saltiness from a few of us - and general indifference from the rest of us.</p>

   <h1>Punishment</h1>

   <p>This is what we're all here for, right? The main event. The Halloween Rally. The Bull and Oyster (RIP). There's been some people pouting (Jack) and whining (Jack) that the punishment isn't causing an excessive amount of physical pain or ruining someone's entire weekend, so I had to do what I had to do and put my foot down. In this section, I'll lay out the specific terms of the punishment, so there's no confusion and no room to argue when the eventual loser tries to weasel their way out of things, and we don't have to wake up to shirtless weather reports in the dark.</p>
   <p>Punishment: Mini Hot Ones Challenge</p>
   <p>Terms:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Non-losers send questions for the loser to commissioner</li>
      <li>Comissioner sends questions to the loser anonymously</li>
      <li>Commissioner sends a bottle of "Da Bomb" hot sauce to loser</li>
      <li>Loser cooks their desired amount of chicken wings</li>
      <li>Loser coats 1 (one) wing entirely in Da Bomb hot sauce</li>
      <li>Loser films themselves eating the entire wing, then answering all questions</li>
      <li>Once all questions have been answered thoroughly, loser may deal with the heat however they please</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The user will be allowed only 1 (one) glass of water OR 1 (one) glass of milk until all questions have been answered. The "loser" will be defined as the person with the least amount of wins/last in the standings after all 18 weeks of the season have concluded. If there are two teams with the same record tied for last place, the tie-breaker will be POINTS SCORED.</p>

   <p>Refusal to participate in the punishment will result in the public shaming of the loser and their immediate termination from the league. Don't be a beta cuck.</p>

   <h1>ESPN Sucks</h1>

   <p>If I put Milk in a room with a couple keyboards on the ground and asked him to write an algorithm to predict each team's final score each week, I guarantee he'd do a better job than whoever ESPN overpays. In this section, we'll take a look at the worst projections ESPN came out with, and just how wrong they over or under shot it.</p>

   <p>Clearly, ESPN leaned too heavily into assuming <b>Boston Weatherman (Matthew James Cunniff)</b> is the same fantasy player he was last year. I won't blame them for that, as that fabled 2020 draft was a legendary trainwreck for our favorite Boston baby boy. That being said, Cunniff came out swinging this week and overshot his projections by a whopping <b>54.3 points</b>.</p>
   
   <p>On the other side of things, <b>Pelosi's Beefcurtains (Sara Aloupis and Matt Thermann)</b> had a disastrous week, and undershot their projections by <b>21.75 points</b>. I guess those beefcurtains were a little too flappable this week.</p>
   
   <p>ESPN's predictions were off by an average of <b>17.39 points</b>, which seems pretty damn bad. I left Milk in the bathroom all night with a keyboard to get that algorithm done and he actually predicted all of our scores perfectly down to the hundredth decimal place. Very impressive stuff.</p>
   
   <p>We'll continue to monitor how ESPN's predictions are throughout the year, hopefully coming to the collective conclusion that they're trash. That way, no one will ever feel confident going into a week regardless of their projections and in turn increasing everyone's stress and disdain for this beautiful fantasy game we play.</p>
 
   <h1>You Got "Lucky"</h1>

   <p>What is "luck"? Is it the product of a little green leprechaun prancing around the end of a rainbow, sprinkling his magical leprechaun dust around the world? Or was it merely invented by salty fourth graders on the playground as an excuse for why they got fucking bodied by Kevin at first base in kickball? Probably somewhere in between. We'll define a "lucky" win as scoring worse than the rest of the league in a week, but still managing to walk away with a big fat "W". An "unlucky" loss means a team scored better than most of the league that week, but still managed to lose. To calculate this, I'm going to take the average score across the league for each week then compare all of the losing team's scores to it to determine who was the "unluckiest", and vice versa for the "luckiest".</p>
   
   <p>Our league average score this week was a <i>pathetic</i> <b>114.64 points</b>.</p>
   
   <p>The luckiest team this week was none other than everyone's favorite little soy boy <b>Earl Thomas' Brother (Elvis Smith)</b> who managed to score a whopping <b>12 points</b> under the league average and win. Thank god for him that he was playing against a poverty franchise like <b>Wharf Rat Owner (Patrick Auth)</b>. Slightly less lucky, but still having a bit of leprechaun magic in his pocket, were the <b>Wuhan Bats (Jack Lynch)</b> who finished just under the league average, and also pulled out a win, and did so with the smallest margin of victory this week (<b>5.35 points</b>).</p>
   
   <p>No one was particularly unlucky this week, in that no one scored above the league average and still managed to lose. If we had to name someone unluckiest, it would have to be <b>Team female playing (Colleen "Lean" McCormack)</b> who finished 6th in scoring (just short of top half) and still walked away with an unnecessarily and quite frankly uncomfortably large L.</p>


   <h1>The Fr. Linnane's Special Little Hound Award</h1>

   <p>The Fr. Linnane's Special Little Hound Award will be awarded weekly to the team who somehow got their shit together enough to score the most points! This is an incredibly prestigious award, and those who win will have the honor of being crowned winner by Fr. Linnane himself.</p>
   <p>The Fr. Linanne's Special Little Hound of Week 1 is...</p>
   <h2>Boston Weatherman</h2>
   <h3>Matthew James Cunniff</h3>

   <p>Congrats, you sucked the least!</p>

   <h1>The Lou of the Week Award</h1>

   <p>We'll cap off our weekly recap by naming one lucky team the Lou of the Week, named after our dear friend Luke aka Lou who tragically fell into Baltimore's murky harbor after an open bar at Barcocina, drowned, and was never seen again. The police conducted a thorough investigation and ultimately suspect foul play, but no one was ever charged. That night haunts my dreams and I haven't slept a full night since. Sometimes I can still hear the screams of Sam the Bartender as he saw Lou take that fatal plunge into the abyss. Sorry, I got carried away. My therapist cancelled on me this week because she had to get her headlight fluid changed. The Lou of the Week is the team who not only managed to lose, but did so in a particularly embarassing fashion by scoring the least amount of points in the week.</p>
   <p>The Lou of the Week goes to, drumroll please...</p>
   <h2>Pelosi's Beefcurtains</h2>

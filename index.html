   <h1>Washed Up Greyhounds Weekly Roundup</h1>
   <h1>Week 2</h1>

   <p>Good Morning Greyhounds! Today in Baltimore, MD, it is 63 degress with a high of 82. Thre is no chance of rain for the rest of the day. And it should be a relatively warm evening, only dropping down to 66 degrees. In Hartford, CT, it is a little chi-</p>
   
   <p>Tom Brady. Tom Brady. Tom Brady. Deloitte. Boston Calling. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.</p>
   
   <p>Wh- what just happened to me? I sat down to write this week's roundup and then woke up on the floor ass-naked clutching a box of cheeseless pizza. Everything feels different. I feel... a little shorter. 20 pounds lighter too. I can't think straight. I'm scared.</p>
   
   <p>Anyway, anyone like riddles? Here's one: take the common abbreviation for a major US city, and put it inbetween the airport code for that city's airport. You should end up with a flower. Whoever guesses it first get's a free pack of Zyns. I mean- a free pack of Zyns. No, a free pack of Zyns. What is happening? All I can't say anything except "pack of Zyns". Wait... Boston, Tom Brady, Zyns??? It's like I'm possessed by... oh God.</p>
       
   <p>Before I run to the local Fells Point exorcist, let's check in with our stupid dumb leaguemates:

   <h1>&#128680;Trade Alert&#128680;</h1>
   
   <p>Alright ladies and gentleman let's take a crack at seeing how this trade is panning out after 2 weeks. Here's a reminder at what was traded:</p>
   
   <table class="center">
      <tr>
         <th>Team:</th>
         <th>Scrub Daddy (Matt Kinloch)</th>
         <th>Wharf Rat Owners (Pat Auth)</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <th>Receives:</th>
         <th>Jalen Hurts, QB (PHI)<br>Graham Gano, K (NYG)</th>
         <th>Devonta Smith, WR (PHI)<br>Younghoe Koo, K (ATL)</th>
      </tr>
   </table>
   
       <p>In the 2 weeks since the trade, <b>Scrub Daddy</b> has gone 2-0 and <b>Wharf Rat Owner</b> has gone 0-2. <b>Wharf Rat Owner</b> started Devonta Smith in Week 2 and benched him in Week 3, contributing a total of <b>2.6 points</b> to his lineup. Smith replaced Robby Anderson in his lineup, resulting in a value of <b>-2.7 points</b>, as Anderson outscored Smith in the week Smith was started. <b>Scrub Daddy</b> started Jalen Hurts in both Week 2 and 3, contributing a total of <b>x points</b> to his lineup. Hurts replaced Tua Tagovailoa, who scored <b>0.65 points</b> over 2 weeks after a Week 2 injury. This resulted in a <b>x point</b> value for <b>Scrub Daddy's</b> lineup. I'll let you interpret the winner so far for yourselves ;)</p>

   <h1>Consistent Constipation</h1>

   <p>What do you guys think happens after we die? I think it's nothing except a terrifying void of blackness for etern- FUCK YOU DON'T ATTACK MY TERRITORY ATTACK JACK!!! YOU'RE A SCUMBAG TRAITOR!!!!</p>
       
   <p>Oh no... it's happening again. I couldn't sleep last night. All I heard was Cunniff's maniacal laugh in the distance, like some sick and twisted version of tinnitus. I don't know how much longer I can take this. While there's still a little bit of me left, let's check in on consistency once more:</p>

   <h1>ESPN Sucks</h1>

   <p>My fake therapist said I made alot of progress this week. I told some absolutely knee-slap worthy relatable humor, and she laughed harder than anyone I'd ever seen anyone laugh before. I guess the humor translated really well, because she doesn't even know you guys. It's almost like she'll validate anything I feel or think because she's completely imaginary. Idk tho, it <i>was</i> pretty funny. She also told me to stop buying homeless people cigarettes and instead do something more productive for them like buy them a house, but idk I think she's in cahoots with the homeless guy.</p>

   <p>Anyway, here's more of this projection bullshit no one cares about. Cunniff stole my whole idea anyway. And possessed me. Tuesdays, am I right guys?</p>

   <p>Analysis</p>
   
   <p>ESPN's projections have been consistently bad, but just like my unrealized alcoholic tendencies, they're not consistent in a good way. This week they were off by an average of <b>16.35 points</b>, which is minimally better than last week's <b>17.39 points</b>.

   <h1>You Got "Lucky"</h1>

   <p>What's the point anymore. I stay up past my bedtime of 10:00pm every Monday to do these stupid little roundups that no one even reads. I just wanted to do something fun for my friends and all they do is bend me over and dookie in my mouth. I could probably just copy and paste 5 pages from <i>War and Peace</i> with some tables thrown in here and there and no one would even notice.</p>
   
   <p>Oh how the mighty have fallen. Last week's Fr. Linnane's Special Little Hound award winner was dethroned in a brutal fashion, as the <b>Boston Weathermen</b> posted the 5th highest score but was unfortunately matched up against our upcoming Fr. Linanne's Special Little Hound winner.</p>
   
   <p>Hopefully you fell for the pity party and kept reading. Now that you're here, you might as well finish out strong and see our weekly award winners. Okay love youuuuu.</p>

   <br>

   <h1>The Fr. Linnane's Special Little Hound Award</h1>

   <p>Really Fr.? This guy? Out of everyone in the league? All of these beautiful little teams and you went and blessed <i>this</i> one with the highest score of the week? You picked an absolute banger of a winner last week, you should do that more often. I mean I kinda understand but... whatever. Just like in fantasy, every week can't be a winner. I won't doubt your judgement. </p>
   <p>The Fr. Linanne's Special Little Hound of Week 2 is...</p>

   <h1>The Lou of the Week Award</h1>

   <p>I haven't slept in weeks. Between this untimely possession, my constant therapy sessions, and writing this roundup, I haven't been myself lately. Not to mention that whenever I do manage to sleep, my nightmares are plagued with visions of Lou. I had another last night. It was so surreal - I was going on my nightly walk around the Fells harbor, and stopped at the spot where Lou sunk. I took a seat, legs dangling over the edge, trying not to lose a sandal to the water. If one fell, I'd never get it back. Just like Lou. I noticed some bubbles directly below me, dancing around the water's surface. I leaned in a bit closer, and the bubbles rapidly grew. I slowly started to make something out through the murkiness of the water. It was... Lou. His body surfaced after all these months. I sprung up and grabbed my phone, ready to call the cops. I got hold of the 911 operator, and turned towards the street to give them my location. Corner of Broadway and Thames, I said. Then it happened. I felt a presence behind me. It was Lou. His bloated, water-logged corpse had risen from the water. It stunk like a pig. It stood there for a few moments, and croaked out two words: "Tom... Brady...".</p>
       
   <p>Wait.</p>
       
   <p>It's starting to make sense. These nightmares, this weird feeling... both mentioned Tom Brady. Does that mean - no. It couldn't have been. Did Cunniff murder Lou? It adds up... I can't remember where Cunniff was when Lou fell. Is this why Cunniff is possessing me? Because he knew I'd find out? I need to get to the bottom of this.</p>
       
   <p>The Lou of the Week is...</p>
